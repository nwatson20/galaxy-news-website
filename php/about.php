					<div class="rowDesc">
						<p>In the past few decades, we have watched the Internet 
						evolve from a simple online distribution tool to a limitless 
						hub for innovation. Unfortunately, this evolution has pushed 
						aside everyday users, especially children. Our mission is to 
						foster a fun and educational online space for children and 
						adults alike, encouraging curiosity and creativity in our 
						youngest generation.</p>
